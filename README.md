# html-element-with-vue

This is a project made during a Vue presentation made by Joe Erickson. It was a demo to show how to make a custom HTML tag from within Vue. Files to note are the build script in the package.json and the Blink.vue component as a whole. Because we export just the component, I don't think it matters what the content is of the main.js or the App.vue.

## Project setup

### Compiles and minifies for production
